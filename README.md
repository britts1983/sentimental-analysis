# Natural-Language-Proccessing

This is a set of beginner level natural language processing codes implemented using Python's NLTK module (Natural Language Toolkit)
There is a folder called 13-Sentiment Analysis which has the codes for classifying a text into positive or negative text which 
uses algorithms like Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, SVC, Linear SVC, NuSVC, Logistic Regression,
Stochastic Gradient Descent and a voted classifier that takes the combined opinion of all the above classifiers to find the results.

The dataset that is used to train the algorithms is the nltk moviw review dataset which comes built-in on installing nltk inn the 
system.
