 Not yet
 Are you sure you wish to do with me? 😂
 I thought after gsss stuff you would never turn back for collaboration
 Random thought
 Wait.. Let me toss an unbiased coin and decide
 😅😂
 Heads
 Thumbs up
 Let's do it
 🙌🏼
 Don't take me wrong but I put in my efforts just to make my team get appreciation.
 And sure.. This time let's divide the work very neatly and let's do it very neatly.
 The day ma'am gives the topic let's sit and chalk out every minute stuff required for the project.
 Okay naa?
 Sari.. Tata then
 DBMS schema diagram and ER diagram to be submitted in the lab that lies in the third week of October
 Pretending also takes energy😂😂
 When to do DBMS stuff?
 So sweet of you for thinking my village has got connectivity
 Before I go home let's figure out what to be done.. may be on coming Tuesday
 And finish off the work during dasara week
 I'll come back on 16th (Sunday) and we shall meet if required on that day if submission is too immediate or if any bugs to be fixed
 Sarey! Hopefully you'll get the connection..
 God bless😅
 You with DFS, BFS, topological sort
 I said.. may God bless you with any of those programs to code during your ADA lab test
 Thathaasthu
 😂😂
 😂😂😂
 Look at you
 😸😺 Dummakka 😂😅
 I don't want one
 😂😂
 Nice... How about AVL ?
 Anyway.. That was enough trouble.. it's 10:30
 I'm done for the day
 Good night!
 http://anushagaarya.bugs3.com/
 I want you to revisit this website and let me know if there is any issue in the display
 It's a bit urgent
 Thanks and sorry for bothering you
 Where did your net meet accident?
 and became slow😅
 Of course.. not
 I'm serious
 Anyway.. load aadmele nodi helu
 And rest of the content?
 Is it rendered properly?
 Latin
 Tomorrow night it will be changed
 Yesterday night six hours full on coding.. Finally done with it
 Uff
 Well that's a random testing text which you add to website before adding actual content
 I too thought the same.. Shall I remove that *design is intelligence made visible*
 May be it's not necessary
 That will be reduced
 ✌🏼
 Sorry?
 Lato family
 Dhanyawad
 😂😂😂
 Dummakka is cute
 Fine . I shall stop
 😅😂
 Okay
 Bye..!
 Good night
 Share with suneha
 Shall I make a deal?
 I never showed interest in listening to your stuff just because I myself had not coped up with my loss
 But now that I sense you're feeling really bad, I would like to know what's wrong
 Please tell me.. I'm your elder brother. Have no doubt in it
 I was under depression during my internship and a week before I cried like anything in my room
 That day everything felt good
 I really felt relieved
 You must throw out your emotions
 And remember, crying alone is the attribute of the strong
 Never let anyone console you while you cry
 It will be incomplete
 Well nick name must be short
 One word
 I'll find one and let you know
 No
 This has a different meaning
 It's foul too
 Who?
 Me and your sis make a great team
 😂✌🏼
 May God bless her with more sense of humor
 Your mood became good I guess
 😂😂
 I know all the reasons for you being upset
 I mean.. I know all the environmental factors
 😂
 There is a risk in sharing. I may be pointed with the accusing finger later
 But yes.. a clue is that you're searching something from outside world
 And your negative thoughts are dominating them
 Starting from your dp..
 Yes.. they all matter
 May be our philosophies differ.. but my spirit science says everything we like or dislike directly related to subconscious mind and our conscious mind is a servant of it
 So.. You still are bothering few people who have hurt you (may be)
 No.. You need another book all together
 I'll give you a book only if you promise me to return it in a day
 *forgave
 Don't forget English in frustration😂😅
 100 page book and very small book
 Seven spiritual laws of success
 The more you read that aloud the more soothing it becomes
 Spiritual means not spirit,devva boothaa
 It's about your soul
 Your psychology
 Your sub conscious
 Your mental strength
 Your attitude to see nature as energy
 Your ability to control your mind
 And what not?
 I can give an hour lecture on that
 What do you open in Google usually?
 Make it a habit to 
 And do keeping visiting Quora
 Sometimes reading a cute romantic love story is such a awesome feeling
 http://thinksimplenow.com/resources/7 Summary of the book
 and this is enough for you to begin with it
 bubye.. I was actually online for you
 Good night
 Hey
 Would you mind doing more percent of DBMS project??
 Because I just got a contract from IIT Patna to develop a website for their event called *Model United Nations* for which I'll be certified too.
 Don't think I'm running away from the work. Time management is the issue. I'll try though. Just that you be ready to take up more than what you're actually supposed to do in DBMS project
 🙃
 Good night!
 <Media omitted>
 May you be blessed with BFS
 Good night!
 How was your exam today?
 You were upset😅
 ಇರ‌ಲಿ ಬಿಡು
 You weren't able to show the graph ??
 Was there issue with implementing in gnuplot?
 What's this new thing to be shown?
 We never showed this
 Oh okay.. I get it now
 Nevertheless.. Don't worry
 That is not something that defines you right?
 Study well for tomorrow's tests
 Yup
 Now about to start DBMS at 10:30
 Till then chatting chatting chatting with people😁
 Cs001
 Ground floor😅
 That's why I mentioned it😅😅
 Be like this
 I felt so bad for a while when you went without responding properly
 Then swati told to leave you
 It's fine.. Be comfortable in life
 Arey
 Those are silly things
 You shouldn't spoil your moment for an exam
 I had not at all prepared for anything today
 😂😂😂
 Awesome
 I know system software questions
 😜😜 You need them?
 It's fine then..
 😂😂
 The greedy fox
 Hey.. I got a conference call from PhD friends from IIT Ropar. That's why i discontented my Wi I do have the questions. You know what, I don't lie!🤗
 Make sure you read everything😂😂
 Meet me tomorrow.. I need to talk about DBMS project
 Tata.. Wish you happy dasara
 Do the work nicely
 Good luck
 🙌🏼
 See .. I replied quickly
 Do whatever you think is better Rachs! 
 So I can't say about it right now. You do go ahead with your thoughts
 Belated wishes of dasara!
 Things are awesome here!
 I'm sleeping upstairs right now looking at stars😄
 Had full stomach delicious food prepared by my mom
 Yo! and Saturday I'll be leaving
 But I don't feel like leaving
 I hope you are not facing any trouble or you're not feeling work load without my contribution in the DBMS stuff !
 Thanks
 Chalo then.. good night!
 Is the ER diagram hand drawn or drawn using computer tools ??
 ಹೌದಾ ? ಸರಿ
 ಆಯ್ತು ನನ್ನ ಮುದ್ದು ತಂಗಿ !!

 Nice
 I need one more big help!
 'birthday' reminds me that I need to prepare a gift for Anusha akka
 For her birthday
 You have seen her portraits and paintings right..
 Would you mind recording yourself (video) appreciating her work and acknowledging your favorite art work
 I will collect from many of my classmates, juniors whom she doesn't know
 Making her feel like celebrity would be the best gift apart from material gift
 Tomorrow let's give it a try
 Her birthday is still far
 And I want her this brother's gift to be the best
 Even her husband must not be able to beat mine
 😂😂
 I shall give sometime. Don't worry..
 Of course
 Let's C++
 Okay.. let's execute all our plans tomorrow
 After college can you stay for fifteen twenty more minutes?
 🙌🏻
 See you then
 Thanks for helping me in making video for anu akka
 Good night!
 I don't have to do anything.. everything is ready in those PDF isn't it ??
 Anyway.. I'll thoroughly go through those at night and I'll write a report at least explaining the flow
 What name shall I write for you in the report?😅
 Dummakka or Rachana?😂
 😂😂😂 so cute
 Try making the video... I'll send you the audio of mine soon
 See if you can involve my little sister
 Also your parents by any chance!
 Now I'll take leave.. I'll text you at night about the progress
 Tata
 What's your usn?
 Report of DBMS
 Cover page details
 Print out beka?
 Check your mail
 Download the copy of the same too!
 Where will you run PHP codes?
 You need to have xamp software for that
 I don't have HTML code kit!😐
 Never prepared it
 But I'll send you anyway
 Yes.. they are code samples of all possible things in php
 There are more than 200 snippets
 😅
 I'll send you the zip file of all the codes
 Just download them
 Max 10MB
 But download and install xamp
 Because I don't have the installation file
 It's bit heavy!!
 Nothing.. all comes in this package together
 If you wish then download the sublime text editor
 Oki😅
 Tomorrow video??
 Or day after?
 Oki
 😬😬 I'm way too excited for that
 Tata
 No.. Tomorrow we have viva
 And I haven't executed those two programs
 Tomorrow if they don't conduct viva for long then o shall execute tomorrow
 Prof Shivamurthy.vcf (file attached)
 Ask him😂😂
 Then what? If you are not convinced by his answers then contact the number before
 Prof Brunda.vcf (file attached)
 😂
 *below
 You can contact her
 Didn't you see how much concern she had towards you
 She was asking about your injury
 Thank me I didn't troll you over there😂😂
 Also thank me for making you get into B2
 Welcome to B2
 Where is the smile?
 Such a dumb thanks!
 😂😂😂
 Do you have anything else to ask?
 Can I go offline?
 😅 You seem really happy today
 Keep it intact
 Good night

 It was chosen in the challenge
 I don't break hearts and promises
 Did you like the quote on dream?
 Wow
 Thanks
 Yours was unique compliment but why no?
 🤓
 good!
 always learn by listening and understand by reflecting
 I have sent you the zip file of all my php codes
 other than file uploading script everything works fine
 It's my responsibility to make you feel like yelling at me!!
 downloading xamp is not a matter of pride though!
 😂
 of course they do!
 They feel proud of using 1GB of data for some stuff
 though they hardly know  what 1GB exactly is !
 well ! This is not the exposure you need
 And up to where is my work done ?
 that's fine
 recommendation I'lll get it from my seniors and other professionals too
 I am speaking about the video!
 for my akka Anusha akka!
 🤗🤗
 Sure!
 *??
 Do it in crazy way.. behave like kids
 choose a place with sufficient light.. Be loud and dress up nicely
 and DON'T say birthday wish

 good!
 My time is up!
 Tata
 You're my 100th LinkedIn Connection!
 So cool!
 Hope your new connection will bring me luck and I'll get placed at Google as UX/UI Designer with awesome salary.
 I shall pray for that!
 May God bless you!
 🙌🏻🙌🏻
 Chalo.. I'm late.. I'll take leave now..
 Good night
 I know where you're going wrong
 Have you placed PHP files in the folder called htdocs?
 And you cannot run it by saying open in Google chrome
 You need to type in URL as
 Localhost/filename (as saved in htdocs)
 Hyper text documents
 Found in the xamp installation folder
 I mean installed folder
 What happened next?
 You cannot save your PHP files anywhere😂😂😂
 You must save them in htdocs
 Now do as I direct
 Where have you installed your xamp?
 Which drive?
 Open the folder
 Scroll down and find xamp Application file
 I mean .exe file
 *Xamp Control
 <Media omitted>
 Okay.. can you come a bit early to college tomorrow?
 I'll look into it
 10:15 ?
 Just give me missed call when you will be leaving your home
 I don't trust your punctuality
 That's why😅
 Let's see it tomorrow
 Now sleep aaramsey
 Get a pen drive!
 We may need it!!
 Xamp
 Working fine now?
 Nice
 Bolo thank 😅
 Oh.. mathth bolo thank you
 😅
 Okay.. try exploring how to create database over there
 Type in URL as
 localhost/phpmyadmin
 Always
 Sorry?
 No code for that
 There is GUI for database creation
 On your left side there will be option called *new*
 Click that follow the instructions
 I was about to start the front end
 So o thought of asking you if it worked
 *I
 Now that it's working.. it's cool.. I'll take leave
 Tata
 *Oki*😅
 <Media omitted>
 Because I was editing video!
 When will you give?
 I embedded your video.. It has come up beautifully
 😍
 Thank you very much!!
 207 MB
 In total
 Shall I show you on Monday!?
 😂😂😂
 good english please
 Didn't get you
 You can use html in .php file but not php in .html file
 Hope this condition is followed
 extension
 yup..!! Change it and verify once if it's working fine
 nice
 dinner?
 For our form?
 As required by the schema diagram
 Add age rather
 That will be better
 Easy to handle
 Integer right😅
 😍 I know that feeling. I can empathize you.
 Party!!
 😅
 I have a work for you
 Me and my juniors are planning to build a technical blog
 Would you like to design the blog for us?
 You'll get the full and complete credits
 Blog means a website of articles
 Updated on regular basis
 By what time can you do?
 Till then we will keep preparing our articles
 No.. list of articles and opening it on click
 Plane html page
 It will be a practice for you too.. I can actually do it right away😅😂
 You wanted to do one for your dad right?!
 I thought this may boost your confidence
 Think and let me know
 Do it with dummy data
 Xyz title and Loren Ipsum text
 🙌🏻
 What name would be good? Think about a name too!
 I too will think
 No need of PHP for our blog
 We will manage manually
 Wait before that
 Learn file handling
 String handling
 Dream viewer won't teach you web designing. Don't get me wrong
 yussss
 Content will give you soon
 May be my juniors will contact you if it's fine for you?!
 Via emails
 🤘🏻
 Now sleep.. I think you worked a lot today
 Don't stress yourself!!
 I'm your doc
 😅
 Tell it in person in college
 Tata for now
 Good night
 I added the one which I recorded
 It has really come up awesome
 And I'm sure my doll sis Anusha will love it
 Thanks for support!!
 I owe you a party
 *You both
 So yours and mine are nullified
 I'll give it to suneha
 😅
 Can you send me that volume less video please?
 😂
 I promise I won't troll or share with anyone for sure.
 Yo🤘🏻
 Video not attached😂😂
 😂😂😂 Why such things happen with only you??
 😂
 😂 May be
 😂😂
 Irli bidu
 Upload it to drive and send me the link
 Alternate way to send big files
 So what.. ?
 😂😂😂
 Latest and trending technologies
 Also code kits will be made available for download
 Frame ??
 Are you speaking about the wire frame or the framework??🤓
 Do it your way! No problem😅
 Anyway, a client can always ask for modifications😂😂
 Never asked on WhatsApp. The data collection is via
 I'll send you a wireframe in another hour and design it accordingly.
 Okay??
 I'll give a simple template requirement. No worries!
 Because I came from office just now.. not yet freshened up too
 I started replying😅

 🤗
 What was taught in CN today?
 Okay.. I shall go through them now
 Thanks
 Good night!
 Then I'll definitely read it very thoroughly😅
 I completed the process of logging in the user into our website
 Plan how to accumulate the airport and airline service details.
 I would suggest we will keep it only for domestic services ! It will be less complicated.
 Perfect
 Can you collect details?
 Of places which has airports, their name
 Blah blah blah
 Airlines and their services..blah blah blah
 Not final.. Tables aren't created yet other than users
 She has taught us things today. How can she expect things to be done tomorrow? Don't worry I'll manage😅
 You take care of your ADA
 And give me your observation book tomorrow so that I can write mine😅😂
 You know what reducing the dependency is normalization
 I'm going to Nishanth's home.. I'll text you later
 Nothing
 He has got few minor injuries on hands and legs. Bike too has got injured!
 His mother will do it
 Yes.. just to know the extent of severity
 I'll code rest of the pages
 Managing or enquiring?😂
 Oh!
 I'll create a GitHub repository of our project
 Further sharing of codes will be done over GitHub.
 Learn importing database in xamp
 Let's not risk our project for it. You work on back end. And for front end you can actually work on our blog.
 Why I'm telling is we need a responsive page which you don't know to create
 But I'll teach you during the course of our project
 Say you have worked equally in back end stuff
 And tell her that it was you who collected data for it.
 I won't make you credit less
 Don't worry
 I'll create the tables and give you. Because I'll show her tables tomorrow
 You insert the tuples!!
 There is always scope to alter the table properties
 You are so innocent!🤗😘
 😂
 Oki😅
 I am busy chatting with ANusha akka
 So i was not waiting for your reply! Don't worry
 I am telling you that was not necessary!
 😅
 🤘🏻
 <Media omitted>
 Nishanth's condition
 Best friend right !
 Did you install pip?
 if yes go to terminal and type in command
 pip install flask
 That doesn't really matter
 Don't worry
 Try installing flask
 Seriously a head ache
 Yes
 Python Web framework
 Try
 sudo pip install flask
 sudo works on Mac??
 Okay
 You know what
 We will have to put in lot of effort
 🤘🏻
 If it was PHP then by this Sunday it would be done😅
 Say python
 On terminal
 >>>
 Is this symbol there??
 Enter there as
 import flask
 If there is no error message
 Then successful installation
 Okay
 Django is PHP framework
 I'll let you know in a while
 If we really need it
 Tomorrow I'm going to ask maam
 What technology does what work exactly
 She has to tell things properly
 I guide my juniors better than them.
 😅
 https://www.tutorialspoint.com/flask/flask_tutorial.pdf
 just try out a few things from this
 and we can handle databases too using flask
 I'm just exploring it
 If that turns out to work fine
 then no need of Django at all
 I still need to complete my ADA observation and record
 I feel like running away somewhere!
 WOW!
 my sis has become so brave!!
 good
 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0DA14EB3618A3507
 flask video tutorials
 may be good!
 flask successfully installed
 you can upgrade pip if you wish
 say python
 do you have a skype account ?
 send username
 I've sent you an invitation
 are you sure ?
 it showing some sneha d'costa and not you
 I searched with your rocketmail id
 I got one
 who is sneha?
 oh
 are you logged in?
 there is some issue
 go to index
 chapter 8
 templates
 and it beautifully describes how to do the front end
 okay
 Even I'll practice
 Till I get some confidence that I'll be able to do things properly I won't feel good
 So today is my night out
 Not necessary
 we'll see
 now i'll complete ADA
 and then start with flask
 and it depends on how much I understand it.
 no.. you sleep
 tomorrow college is at 9:30
 okay
 carry on
 then
 good luck
 Sure
 Community
 Professional is paid I guess
 Nice
 Try creating a few database
 And connecting them and
 Play around
 This needs Python module called MySQL db
 Install that using pip
 What command did you use to install MySQL??
 Before
 For this
 🤘🏻
 Arey.. try finding the proper spelling
 I sent you a random one
 😂😂
 Let me check
 Give me a minute
 http://codeinthehole.com/writing/how need not install pip again
 just use the last two commands
 yeah.. those not needed
 apt use this
 pip install MySQL after that one
 say sudo before that if it doesn't work
 I run my system as a root
 So i don't have to use 'sudo' every time
 what error?
 Screenshot please
 Till now that was working right?
 Do one thing
 Say
 Sudo su
 When prompted for password
 Enter it
 Your system password
 Yes
 It has taken it from previous stuff o guea
 *I guess
 Now type that command
 Without sudo
 Copy paste it
 You don't have jdk installed I guess
 Copy paste this error and Google for it
 I am not getting
 The reason
 🤘🏻
 Whichever works
 Things going good??
 😅
 What type of error?
 And in what?
 MySQL or flask?
 In import MySQL stuff??
 username must be given as root
 Hmm
 Cool
 🤘🏻
 Tomorrow software engineering surprise quiz
 I'll study now
 Tata
 😅😅
 Sumne heldhe
 😂😂😂
 No clue.. But there is a rumor that to prevent mass bunk he may conduct quiz tomorrow
 What?
 Don't study
 Nobody is studying
 <Media omitted>
 Study study😅👍🏼🤘🏻
 Will remain with me forever
 Be good to me always!!
 When's your birthday??
 Avththu dp idthini!!😂😂
 And did you see my dp?? Anusha akka is sketching that for me!
 Wish I could
 Let me see 😂😂 I'll think about it
 But for now
 Good night
 I need to get up at 4
 Well I'm writing 'open when you're feeling <some feeling> ' letters for someone
 I need peace and freshnesa
 *freshness
 Seven letters in total
 Tomorrow will be the first one.
 By the time her birthday comes.. I'll finish off seven
 Tata
 I just happened to come from NRP Sir's office
 Will start now after taking a minute of breathe
 😅
 Your fate is so bad😂😂
 In which laptop are you downloading?
 ☹
 Why?
 Why only you??😂
 Oh
 Try it.. I'll shortly begin things
 And tomorrow you can practice in my laptop
 What will you copy?
 I have don't have the installation file
 I installed directly from command line
 Why don't you borrow someone's laptop on your family for sometime
 ??
 Like your brother's
 😅
 Please do that
 I feel so frustrated with all this and I can empathize you😂
 This refers to issues with MacBook
 Installation and stuff
 Learn it
 Okay
 I'll jump to work now
 We need to add attribute called auto increment to all primary keys of all our tables
 Tomorrow let's populate the tables
 I'll have a good analysis and I'll learn the implementation part now
 What time?
 Give me a call about it
 Tomorrow morning
 Okay I'll be there
 ER Diagram and schema please
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
 do it slowly
 absolutely no urgency !
 10 is good
 I'm creating the proper login, home and signup pages
 you learn bootstrap
 you can go ahead with booking page
 good realization
 I shall teach you by involving you
 let's do it over there tomorrow!
 You'll have a hands on session tommorow
 😅
 😂😂😂
 actually html is huge
 not as easy as people think
 good good
 Anyway.. I'll take leave
 Carry on
 Try finishing er diagram using online tools
 Registration and login are working awesome
 🙃🙃
 I received your email
 Checking it
 Actually my wifi pack is over. Now net is running at 512 kbps
 So a bit slow in loading
 Also in exchange of messages
 I was rather expecting this🙃😂
 Downloading.....
 Looks awesome
 Great work😍
 You appreciated yourself😂😂 grammatical mistake.
 And you know when you do good ; I do appreciate you.
 But in life
 Always it's criticism that will take you higher.
 Dummi
 Carry on
 I'll work on home page and elegance of website and then I'll send you screenshots.
 Dinner aaytha? Dummakka😅
 Downloading...
 😪
 For project sake??
 Your dad mom will scold me.. don't do so
 Okay
 Users  Something missing!
 Let me stare it for a minute.
 Any thoughts to fix it?
 It must be something like user refers the schedule and then books the ticket.
 But the question is
 If schedule is entity or relationship.!
 This can be done.
 You rather have already done it as airline company *owns* airplane
 Where owns is not a table
 Think about this for a while
 Yes
 It is allowed
 Awesome
 You know what I just happened to draw the same thing
 Ditto
 I'm sending a pic
 <Media omitted>
 Now that you have received it. Start it. As both are one and the same. Draw the one you love. It's your call.
 👽
 Cool
 In that case.. Go ahead!
 Say thanks to your dad for helping us out in these stuff
 A high five from my side!!
 ✋🏼
 To him.
 Sure
 Perfect
 Sorry for late reply
 I had been to shave my beard😅
 I guess no
 And try writing the cardinality ratio
 And see where and all there is complete participation
 And draw double line for that link
 Good night
 Get good sleep
 And awesome work🤘🏻
 Do we really have to meet?
 Because those rogues over there create scenes
 No plans as such
 😂😂
 Okay let's meet at 11
 Please.. my those dialogues were just to tease you. If that was the case then my teammate would be Nishanth.
 Those people actually thought we were not there for project. We had come over there for time pass and that bothers
 That's also there. I enjoy peaceful environment. But not always. I am versatile. I do  adjust.
 May be you are right. I will teach people nice lessons after nice planning. I have one for everyone. I'll execute them. I'm the worst person as far as such things are concerned.
 Let's meet tomorrow
 Now you go to sleep. Take rest
 🤘🏻
 And how to add text in the er diagram tool which you have used ?
 Yes.. lucidchart
 No
 To add text outside
 I want to add the cardinality ratio
 But I'm not finding any tool for text boxes
 I got
 I got
 Tomorrow I'll take rest then
 With respect to project
 Then I'll go to Coorg and come back. I'll plan now.
 Arrows are fine
 One day.. If my plan looks proper now.. then I'll leave in another two hours
 At 3:30 or 4
 Ride in mist and fog😍
 I'll take leave now
 Tata
 Good night
 No.. trip cancelled due to new moon day 😅😅 mummy said so!!
 <Media omitted>
 Sorry! But I was really not at all sleepy. So I thought of doing this! *Don't yell* 😅
 Same to you
 Listen
 You got to somehow install MySQL and all in your system you know
 My laptop hinge is broken
 I may not be able to get that to college
 No.. like contact someone who is sound in using Mac and get it installed
 Fine
 It's awesome
 Extremely awesome
 I'll find how to export and import the databases
 <Media omitted>
 With reference to someone who would help you installing stuff in mac
 Cool
 There are few challenges though
 Actually I changed the date time data type to date
 Because the former was very tough to handle
 Also now.. I'm finding it difficult to place a *book* button and book tickets for a specific trip id directly
 Your dp song : you have a mobile, you have a table.. uhh table  No.. It's very complicated. And in tutorials point they have recommended not to use so.
 Yup if you are free
 If you want to spend time with your relatives then it's not an issue
 I'll handle the rest stuff tomorrow and DBMS project will be done and dusted
 So early??
 Oh
 Install all Python modules too in your sony
 Like flask, pip and all
 It runs what OS?
 Windows 7?
 Okay install them all
 Tomorrow if you are coming then we will finish off everything
 But my laptop is to be carefully handled
 Paapa vayassaaythu adikke
 Today it didn't tolerate my roughness
 When can you come?
 10?
 Chupp .. I take care of my things like my mom.
 Cool
 I know
 I think I have heard this dialogue somewhere
 🤔
 Oh yeah.. you had said it yesterday😂
 Yo🤘🏻
 If one person in the team knows it is same as entire team knowing it.
 What?
 Now I'm confused with the context
 😅
 Anyway.. let's meet at 10 tomorrow
 Give me a call while you leave
 Good night!
 Final touch and it will be ready
 I'll push the code onto GitHub after that
 I told you right.. there will be issues in college
 You never listen to me
 I asked him what was wrong.. He said few people were caught doing dirty things in the recent past
 So measures have been taken it seems
 Anyway.. I'll go work now
 Tataaa
 *they're
 😂
 I'll send you a file
 Tell me if you can prepare the report exactly the same way
 Exactly I mean : ditto
 It's 4.2 MB and hence will take time to get uploaded and forwarded
 A bit of patience will suffice😅😂
 Don't you feel bad ?.. I trouble you so much !!
 <Media omitted>
 This is what I expected
 Thanks for not minding my trolls
 That report is of my senior
 Prepared in latex
 Neatly done
 Neatly formatted
 And they have covered each and every little stuff related to project
 I am looking forward to prepare the same way
 I'll again divide the work. Don't panic
 🙌🏻
 I also need to teach you to pose for photos differently. I have always seen the current dp pose or the flight mode pose😂
 Stretching hands like wings😅
 I shall teach. 😅
 Have your brunch
 I'll jump over to work
 Tataaa
 Guess what
 Booking is working fine
 👻👻
 We are 75℅ done
 🙌🏻🙌🏻
 You tell me which all sections of the report you wanna write??
 And I'm feeling very happy!!
 I will think and let you know
 Try doing the first page in latex and let me know how much comfortable you were doing it
 Negative
 No
 Don't you watch army or defense movies??
 Irli
 Because you didn't get the word 'negative' as no
 🤘🏻
 Put them all in center🙃
 No actually the margin on latex will be too much on either sides
 Do one thing right now drop it! We'll ask ma'am what all to include and prepare it later
 🤘🏻
 I'm going out now
 I'll text you later
 Awake?
 One minute I'll send you a video
 You know what project was not as easy as we thought
 It made me cry at some stages today😭😅
 If you had joined me then you too would cry along with me😅
 <Media omitted>
 Better that you were safe
 My sis right. I'll keep you safe.
 Yes
 Few functionality disorders😂
 I think so😅
 Hell lot
 You know what used to happen
 It never showed where the error was
 It used to say
 Internal server error
 And that's it
 Where on earth should I search in code to debug it😅?
 That's what
 Last two hours has been really really hectic for me
 Yet I did it💪🏻
 🙌🏻🙌🏻
 What was that? I forgot?
 No yaar.. Don't kill me.. I am seeing other students who are doing it with Java here at hostel
 They are dying unable to connect jdbc
 😂
 Sumit
 Sandesh and all
 You know when we start such things we must first thoroughly read the documentation
 Which we don't do
 And this we find it hard to implement
 But it can't be done in a day or two and we will not be patient enough because of dead lines
 What reward will I get?😅
 Keep it pending
 I'll ask some other time🙃
 Ohoooo
 😅😅😂😂😂😂
 Even that's there
 May be in a team till now, I enjoyed with you to the second best extent
 Yo
 No. No. I did comedy
 What?
 I don't remember my trolls
 😅
 Was I smiling that time?
 😅
 Not done
 Eeehh
 Still admin login is remaining
 Not we! Probably you'll do that😅
 Get me those episodes
 And I'll finish those pages don't worry
 No no
 Season 3
 Has the flash from other earth come now?
 Come on.. he comes far before that
 May be in early episodes
 Jay gerrick is the character name
 Oh! I think you haven't watched every episode
 In sequence
 Flash kills zoom
 And changes the timeline again
 And goes back to timeline where his mom is alive
 And in season three he is with his family
 Wally west also will be having speed power
 Yes exactly
 And zoom is none other than Jay gerrick
 Who kidnaps Dr. Snow
 Even I forgot😅
 Good good!! If you had watched video tutorials with such interest then you would have become master in flask
 😂
 Good night
 😂😂😂
 True in one sense
 Anyway
 Now go to sleep
 Good night
 Let's update our first project in LinkedIn !
 I directly copy pasted it from geeks for geeks
 I haven't written it in my observation😅
 Yes
 Indeed it showed proper graph
 I think vatsalya has the code written fully her
 No😞
 <Media omitted>
 😂😂😂
 This one was epic though😂
 I too will catch such pics sometime
 😂😂
 Actually I got few pics of Swati
 Troubled her for a while
 Next was your turn😂😅
 If a team happens then your birthday will be epic
 😅
 Yo👻
 Your dp
 Another epic pic😂😂
 But you look funny👻😂
 Seriously you changed the dp??😂😂
 But your act was funny😂😂😂
 🙌🏻 exactly
 You should apply red eyes in such cases
 It's an effect removes shine in eyes
 You should have that devil attitude first😂
 Then looks😂
 See.. devils don't laugh
 And they don't tolerate trolls
 😂
 See you tomorrow
 Good night
 There ??
 Ada programs send maadu
 Those which are after Boyer Moore
 Sufficient😂
 Got them
 Dhanyawad
 What's the syllabus of fafl?
 😪
 Don't know.. may be something tiresome😂
 😂
 First I'll complete observation
 Then I'll study for one hour
 Then I'll start writing our report
 Then I'll code for sometime
 Then I may sleep
 😂
 See you're chilled out
 If you come early to college tomorrow then let's complete report writing to good extent
 Awesome🙌🏻
 Then come at 9:15😅
 Okiiiiiiii ?
 Sooner the better.. because summertime will be spent trolling you
 😂😂
 Rest all time must be strictly dedicated project
 No no
 Give me call while you leave
 Everything working good.
 I'll share the link of overleaf where I have begun!
 Congratulations and cheers on successful completion of DBMS project. 🙌🏻🎊🎉
 Are you volunteering ?
 Oh okay
 I'm doing it.
 Did you see the report?
 I wrote till scope
 Now I'm writing system analysis and requirements analysis
 😅
 Okay
 Demilovato📢
 Will you complete the schema diagram over lucid chart ?
 I embedded the ER diagram in the report. I need to embed the schema too🙃
 There are few connections that are not done
 And the arrows are not straight
 The straight arrows are forming loops and then proceeding towards the entity table
 Ask
 Tomorrow?
 Not coming to college?
 9:30 class?
 This is why I hate being in class group
 Waste ideas and waste plans
 Come to college
 And let's finish off report
 I'm not comfortable until this DBMS is done totally
 That's why I bunked today the system software class too
 Just to fix those errors
 I'll be in college at 9:30
 Because it's web which I love things have to be prefect
 Yes.. we will show her on Monday
 Oka
 y
 Get your laptop only
 🙈
 I need to stay back whole day after that. It may be a problem for me to carry mine
 Yup
 Report is in overleaf
 Egjactly
 And thank God
 You got them
 😂
 And what a line being straight forward?😂😂😂
 Lines will be just straight😂😂
 Not straight forward😂
 Auto correct gets trained in the way you use it
 😂😂
 Okay then.. be on time tomorrow.. if class is there then I'll finish it off myself on Sunday
 Otherwise let's do it tomorrow.
 Good night
 Rachana..
 The airport table is not completely visible dude!!
 Even I tried to fix it but it's not getting within the margin
 Yup
 The tuples
 No.. Code is fine..
 I'll ask few people who are better than me in latex
 And see if something can be done
 That's fine
 The thing is
 If it's not fixed then let's embed the screenshot of the tables😅
 At the end
 Yeah.. I saw that
 By tonight I'll finish writing the report and ping you.
 Go enjoy your time
 And I enjoyed a lot with seniors wearing there graduation cap😅
 While writing this report, I am feeling good about we being a team
 😘
 Lovely sister!😅
 'Help' mostly the only thing which I never expect from anyone under any circumstances. Because if i ask one, I've seen people asking ten as a part of reciprocation😅
 Why I liked your partnership was because you didn't act as negative influence.
 You were like 
 Though it meant 'maadu maadu'😂
 And yes.. I've fixed the table overflow issue in the report.
 Even now you have done good 🙌🏻
 At least I hope, you learnt something new from me
 Wow!
 Let me know if you need any assistance in your venture😅
 Nice thought
 Coding will improve day by day
 Don't worry
 May be you don't try to analyse your mistakes
 😂😂
 I'll give you questions
 Try coding them
 Write a C program to count the stars in the night sky!
 😂😂😂
 Ends up in segmentation fault
 The answer is
 Print the string infinite
 😂😂😂
 Well.. where is the count being increased?
 I need a number right?
 Well.. that question was a troll
 You took it seriously😅😂
 I'll send you few good questions later
 You can try them
 Now I still need to complete the report
 *"Please complete it anna"
 Will tell you if needed!
 I have that much rights on my sister I guess
 😅
 Chalo bubye
 <Media omitted>
 Finally! Done with it. Now I shall sleep!!
 Go through the project report very well! and search for spelling mistakes!
 I have made few spelling mistakes deliberately and you need to point them out compulsorily to show me that you went through thoroughly !! Along with them find if there are other typos too.
 and don't share with anyone right away
 Good night!
 Normal form description was missing. I have updated that too! Go through that also.
 Are you sure?
 Even I thought so
 Let me remove
 😂
 VR is vasantha raghavan right?
 Yes yes.. I just happened to change it
 And even in introduction there was a grammatical error
 I changed that too
 Did you find any other spelling mistakes or grammatical errors?
 I'll update them
 And hey.. the book tickets table also has class as an attribute
 Which must be added
 Are you on overleaf right now?
 I think I added it later for some purpose
 Yo... Changed
 Pro cess😅
 I'll have to decrease the font size only for that column
 Then entire table looks odd I guess
 I tried giving a line break
 Didn't work😂
 Didn't get you?
 Refresh the doc
 Now and see
 wait for it! Now those insert, update words are in one single line
 i used \hspace{arg} to set it
 I really want to add the word 'dummakka' somewhere in the report
 😅
 and i'll do it in populated tables of user!! 😂😂
 irli please
 😂
 amazing!
 I'll look into that table wait
 anything to make my sister happy
 😅
 next ?
 I want this to become best you know ? Teachers must keep this as reference
 😇
 Remeber.. All you need to say is we have used python flask web framework to do this application. The front Don't ever take the word html in front of them. Just say Jinja2 templates integrated with flask
 that's it
 good.
 Now come to the top of the document!
 now start going through every page (superficially with intuition) and start sending page 1 okay, page 2 okay and so on. This is one final round of review.
 If you feel some sentence messy, go through it!
 I too will do the same
 page 1, Table of Content(page 2 and 3) and page 4 good for me!
 moving on to page 5 and 6 for introduction section
 Well expressed aim,objective and scope! Existing typos and errors eliminated.
 it's positive
 good till page 6
 That I have mentioned as a part of future scope right!
 package booking and return ticket concept
 remember every content of report! They may confuse us sometime.
 Be sure with nook and corner.
 And do read and understand about WGSI and all those definitions that I have written.
 okay! I'll go through it now. You too do it and send a final acknowledgement. We'll mail it to ma'am at night
 after that!
 oki !!
 What happened in the afternoon classes?
 Didn't feel like attending
 Good!
 I rather came back to apply for internships at companies like Google, Thoughtworks, Zomato, etc.
 Because every company has a different format of application and cover letters, I was sure it would take pretty time doing all this.
 Good night
 No.. today I'm going to start image processing
 That's why
 1. ATMs are not going to work for next 2 days i.e., 9th and 10th November.
 Be prepared
 <Media omitted>
 India got MODIfied and USA may get TRUMPed. .
 Seriously this is so awesome move by honorable modiji
 Surgical strike against black money vendors
 Modiji zindabad
 I know
 God knows
 I'm writing my research paper
 Now
 I won't be able to reply
 Please don't mind
 Dummu!! Ma'am asked to make one change
 In the cancel ticket module
 To show the tickets to cancel whose date are after today
 And not the trips that are prior to today (today in the sense, the day when the user is checking it)
 Need to do that and update in the report
 I absolutely didn't get what you said!!😐
 You make me feel that I don't know English😂
 Deepak Urs had done it recently
 Sir asked him to join the next session
 So I think he will tell you too the same
 In that case I rather suggest you to contact him during March
 Next session is in summer
 Oh nice! I didn't know that.
 naduthota@gmail.com
 Don't give my reference🙈
 You can add your weight😂😂
 Well, I had given
 People usually do
 Even without reference things may work out I guess
 The thing is, if you don't do good their name will be spoilt. They won't refer you again.
 😅
 And you need to be very dynamic to work under him.
 Just tell him you want to work under him and ask him to take a look at your resume
 Sufficient
 He doesn't explain again. He says what must be learnt
 What is trending?
 And what are the tools available to do them
 That's it
 He gives ideas sometimes
 He doesn't help you debug your code
 Or he doesn't teach what big data is like classroom
 He does a brief discussion
 But he is awesome
 😅
 See at the beginning of my session there were around 11 Now there are only 7
 People were unable to continue under him.
 When I joined him
 So.. firstly you must be very enthusiastic to learn things in a short time
 Which you don't usually do
 😅
 Consider.. Bootstrap for example
 Did you continue looking into it?
 No..
 Project done.. so it's done😂😂
 What I sense is, you're wishing to attend because many are attending.
 😂😂😂
 Things are discussed in the context of *short time*
 And you're telling before 3rd year
 Come on demilovato😅
 Do do
 Wish you good luck!
 Ask me if you need any help
 Anyway.. I'm working on image processing now. Got to go
 Tata
 by the way, I forgot to tell you
 ma'am did appreciate the project work
 she was asking, "how much was done by whom".. I said, "Ma'am such questions divide people and do you have any plans to reduce the problems if exists?".. She was like, "Will you ever give a direct answer??"
 We both had a good laughter then
 Then I told we celebrated diwali in college working together
 mamimala
 *manimla
 *manimala
 😅
 she is fine with the report
 asked to do a few changes which i did
 in appendix A, list of figures was added
 objectives were changes
 *changed
 and a write about personal satisfaction was also added
 In project  I'll do them with you this Friday
 come early to college if possible
 Tell them that I have shown the project to manimala ma'am and it has been reviewed
 If you want, then just show them the report present in overleaf
 I could give you my laptop to show them the application
 but i don't want them to suggest any other changes
 concern lies there😂
 chalo fine then. i suddenly recalled that I didn't tell you about ma'am's "very good".. so texted you
 good night
 Dumms
 Tomorrow morning barthiyaa?
 9:30?
 I made the changes which ma'am told
 But report swapla edit maadbeku
 Will you do it now..?
 Great
 Now I'll tell you the changes
 in implementation steps, section 4.3
 we got to write it more systematically
 Like the first two points are fine
 next points need to be nourished
 You got to specifically mention the operation like
 when a user books a ticket of a particular class, that many tickets will be reduced from *schedule* table
 similarly when he cancels, that many tickets will be increased in schedule table
 and then that tuple will be deleted from bookedTickets
 LIke this you need to explain every query that is being employed in our coe
 *code
 maadtiyaa ?
 yes exactly
 you are looking at the latest report in overleaf right?
 because yesterday I made few changes in the report again
 No, for each @app.route() def
 explain what that module is doing
 yes
 would you mind of i give you an example ?
 😅
 cancel ticket module  you need to explain the above in an elaborated fashion
 that's it
 Line cut aaythu
 Anyway
 Go through code thoroughly
 I'll sent you the mail too
 I'll stay online today😅
 any doubts ?
 🙈🙈
 One second
 i'm now populating the schedule table with new tuples
 with tomorrow's date
 😅
 in our db now the schedule is for date 2016 that 2016 *not be used
 it will show
 *no services*
 😂
 why fear when I'm here?
 🙃🤘🏻
 All programs working good
 I'm looking into it
 I won't make any changes right now
 Don't worry
 Awesome spellings😅😂
 Of course you'll I know
 😅😂
 Good sentences though
 I corrected them all
 By the way
 Ask me to tell you few standards
 Of writing sentences tomorrow
 And you must use \lq and \rq
 For single quotes
 Irli
 Anna is there for you😅
 And see
 Point 6
 Sentences must start with capital letters😅😂😂😂
 😅😂😂
 Okay okay
 Say you are done
 And then I'll look into It
 Yes
 Absolutely
 You seem relaxed
 😅
 <Media omitted>
 😂😂😂
 😂
 😂😂
 Make it elephant
 It's fine😂😂
 Nested begin{itemize}
 Will do it
 Already you have a \item right
 In that item
 Start your new
 \begin itemize
 Great👍🏼
 <Media omitted>
 See I changed your name
 Cute right😂
 😂😂
 Great yaar
 Awesome work
 You made those nesting neatly
 I saw them
 Perfect
 I think you only need to write about account settings now
 Well I happened to edit it😅
 It's done
 😂
 Gimme a sec
 will look at it at the end
 but for now
 points are perfect
 you can go ahead with account settings and ticket history explanation
 👊🏻
 https://youtu.be/DX2RakfTpRk
 That's my sis!
 It's showing some error
 Please look into it
 Line 450 alli
 <Media omitted>
 if you are not getting any error
 then
 download the pdf and send me
 okay
 guddi
 problem solved
 underscore was creating issue
 it must be prefixed with \ as escape sequence
 sorry! I wanted to say dummi only
 but guddi was written unknowingly
 happened to remember adithi for a while!😣 that's why it came so
 I think so
 let me go through the report for a final time
 you to go through
 We will get back here after we read it fully
 cool!
 means a lot
 she actually went through this report
 but didn't specify anything about abstract
 what do you think?
 shall we write?
 to be on safer side
 yeah.. i thought she would ask for it
 okay let's write
 yup
 why?
 i have told that there is no real mail sent to user
 no dummus! Let it be that way
 come on! let's write abstract
 before introduction title page
 create a pagebreak
 and write same as introduction in a brief way
 extreme brief way like
 imagine yourself
 explaning this project to neha
 and write the same content
 i'll over overleaf looking at the edited text
 if there are any changes i'll be telling
 you too can keep refining it
 perfect
 i'll do that
 actually wait
 index is created automatically
 so you go there and create a section called abstract
 i created that section
 you can go and edit
 now you delete any one
 okay
 line 72
 in latex code
 illinda edit maadu
 actually yeah.. this is something redundant we need to write but
 😂
 eeh no
 abstract must be in paragraph
 first link in google
 please please remove it
 😂😂
 i'll write wait
 did you read ?
 let it be ours only
 they have used different technologies
 give me a minute and be online
 yo
 one more minute
 sorry for inconvenience
 I know you''ll never do project with me again.. but this last and first time, let's do best
 😅
 done with report
 uff
 yeah one final feedback about me being your team mate please..
 how did you feel working with me?
 I loved working with you.. firstly because you're my lil lil lil sis who never got angry on my trolls
 the other reason is, you were positive most of the time
 next reason is you did show interest in learning new things
 one expectation  there is always scope for improvement (i'm telling this including myself)
 😅
 look at report once
 superficially
 in me too downloaded it
 congratulations on successful completion of DBMS project and our first project together!
 Cheers
 and thanks for support and co 👻
 please don't dance.. I care about earth and earthquakes
 that's there
 😂
 see you
 tata
 There?
 The resume looks cool
 And why had you called a few moment ago ?
 I don't remember our conversation🙈
 Irli🙃
 You told you marked the answers already🤔
 It's good. Concise and precise
 One sec, I'll send you
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
 Wow
 You wrote in bluebook?
 <Media omitted>
 Cool
 Give me tomorrow
 I'll complete the rest questions and give you on Monday
 yeah
 good night
 all that matters now is completion of assignment in some sense
 come on ! But if there are any extreme mistakes, I'll let you know
 because few questions from them will be appearing in exam too
 good!
 Fine then get me yours tomorrow without fail
 and did you watch the screen recording ?
 actually
 you wanted to put some background images right?
 So i added one
 Let's see if we can submit tomorrow
 otherwise, I'll add some more functionalities to it
 in the sense, I'll try adding 'book' button in front of every suggestion
 I guess, i figured out a way to do that
 and I
 will be satisfied once I give it a try
 Anyway.. I have got some work to do. See you tomorrow in college
 You too sleep now!!
 And get me assignment!!😅

 That's the beauty of image processing. I'm feeling so happy for simulating something that is used in real time
 This feeling had come to me when I had developed captcha using PHP
 In third sem
 Right now, I'm feeling so awesome. Just because this logic came to my mind because I have understood everything about an image representation🙃😇😄😃
 Anyway.. I had shared this with my juniors. Now I got to answer few of their questions. I'll take a leave
 Tata
 Have a nice day
 Bolo
 Well you just made me too run out of ideas saying that 😂😂
 You wish to give a gift?
 Surprise?
 I actually plan my surprises months before! Suddenly to suggest one it's difficult and I don't know her as a person.
 So someone who knows her is a better person to discuss with.
 Right at this time, I'm feeling that you must write a lengthy letter to her expressing her importance to you which she can read when you're not nearby.
 You write quotes ?? I never knew. "Run, run, run. Doesn't matter if you're fat till the goal is reached!"😂
 Mixed emotions!
 Cool
 See.. even if I suggest some idea now. It will be from mind and surprises must be ideas from heart.
 So my suggestions right now won't be candid
 If you feel it's good
 Then go for it
 Because I never gave my mom surprises 😂
 And yeah if this surprise is a sequel (I.e., if you had given surprise last time too) then give a break.  
 Yeah
 🤘🏻
 Image processing
 😅
 Color filtering kalithidhdhe
 No news
 We will submit don't worry
 They only will ask for it
 Yeah
 I forgot to take it
 😂
 Congrats
 You could have given me after the class right!
 If you come to the bench when others too are present, then such things are sure to happen😂
 Feel a celebrity!
 Can I take leave now?
 Don't hold bikes that way. Because they will be stopped in first gear. Any mishandling of clutch will make the bike to jump ahead!
 😅 haha
 Which one looks good?
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>

 Dumms! After internals, I suggest you too to start image processing stuff
 May be, we can do one more project during vacation!
 Python
 And theory about image
 That's it!
 https://github.com/AxiomSamarth/DBMS

 Refer the link when someone asks you to show the code of the project in future.
 Hey hey
 Sorry

 Good night
 <Media omitted>
 Ada lab done. Started at 11. Ended at 11:30😇
 N Queens
 Awesome😍
 And you were so upset that day 😂😂
 I'm trying out something new in Anusha akka's website.
 I think I'll be successful.
 I'll let you know the status by night. Because right now alpha testing is going on😂
 And I'm unable to focus fully as I again need to get back to college at 3
 I'm looking at watch every now and then.
 Had you called me?
 Well I was holding his phone and mine was in airplane mode
 I haven't written the last question
 Any of you write and send me😅
 I'm almost done with voice explanation you know
 May be by 7:30.. you can see it online😍
 Is there anything that I think about and can't realize?😅😄😄
 Thanks thanks!☺
 What?
 I asked is there anything which I can't realize?
 Apparently I was telling that i can realize whatever I think of!
 Yes
 Wait
 I'll send you the link.. just check and let me know if it is good or not
 https://anushagaargya.github.io/#gallery
 zoom them in
 Not image processing. I tried out a new way of bordering the images and it worked out. My name for that style  Thank you! I won't tell this update to Anu akka.
 Let her see by herself and get surprised!
 haha
 did I tell you that I hosted this in different domain because previous was hacked by indonesian hackers ?
 <Media omitted>
 See, they had brought my that website to this state
 You know, there were chances that visitors devices would also be hacked. So firstly, I lodged a complaint in Google and then I deleted whole website and its indices in the Google
 So that no one would visit it!
 That url doesn't exist anymore.
 Later I hosted in github which is safe

 Oh sorry! I forgot that I had to tell you that and I submitted also😂
 *Advanced DBMS* and *Data mining and Data warehousing*.
 Such a life will have kick in it.😍
 I know that

 <Media omitted>
 I'm thinking of what to do in coming vacation?😂
 I'll getting mad without getting any ideas
 If you have something then tell
 Byaada bidu
 Implement by yourself😂
 I'll think by my own
 You have to
 Otherwise it is same as killing your ideas with your own hands
 Good
 Pursue your passion
 In every possible way you can
 Do your work consciously
 It will help you find what makes you passionate about something
 Hmm
 Are you speaking about this one or other one?
 It's about some compression Algorithm
 I wish to implement any compression algorithm
 Learn computer vision
 You know what..
 Amrutha akka has uninstalled WhatsApp
 Now I feel kinda bored to use my WhatsApp
 I don't share my problems with little sis
 But I do with Ammu akka
 Because you're my little sis
 I never wish to bother my little sister
 Sorry?
 Where's your mom?
 She won't bother her brother😂

 Tata
 <Media omitted>
 You're most welcome!!
 Sending wishes at early 00:00 hour is too mainstream😬 So I sent it at later part of the day😅
 I'm glad you liked it🙃
 I don't justify such things.
 Let's go with your words.
 At the end of the day, all that matters me is my little sister's happiness😘
 Go sleep now. See you at college tomorrow
 Yup
 When will they issue if not tomorrow
 Other departments have been instructed to come at 11
 Chalo then.. I'll sleep now
 Good night
 And HaPpY birthday again🎊🎉
 Probably the first time when this word *thanks* is spelled fully.
 The word *thanks* is thanking me for that😄
 <Media omitted>
 I have a simple project for you
 Visit this
 http://documentneed.com
 One such thing for our college!
 Gagan and Harshavardhan who did that are my juniors.
 I'm their mentor!
 This is to be done in this vacation!
 Then do it
 😂 simulate it fully
 It's for you
 I'm not doing anything
 Ning ondh idea kotte ashte
 I think I've motivated you enough till date. Now it's beyond my capacity
 😬😬
 Yup... You need to do all those things. Besides you must create download links
 The challenging part is organizing properly
 Work with some team mate
 Anushree and Nisarga
 Good good
 What all did you implement?
 I shall talk to them and ask to do things as a team!😬
 The way you tell..😬😂
 Did I tell you that I coded a ML algorithm that predicts the type of cancer?
 For me started  There are few conditions for a cancer being benign or malignant
 If you give those conditions, my code will tell you what type is the cancer
 With 98℅ accuracy
 I have a dataset which I use to train my algorithm
 My implementation is for real world.
 I'll explain in few steps.. Listen
 1. I have a dataset which has the conditions (symptoms or observations) along with its respective class or type of cancer.
 2. I use this to tell my algorithm to understand the conditions of tissues and learn the type of cancer for such conditions
 3. It learns.
 4. Now give the new observed conditions
 It verifies from its lessons and gets you the result
 I trained my algorithm with 400 observations
 Real time observation
 And later I made it to predict for some more predetermined observations.
 Yes.. Those people can use this to cross verify their prediction
 😬
 😂😂 eh no
 By curve fitting
 This curve fitting can be linear or multi dimensional
 In my case it was 9 dimensional curve fitting
 I can't actually imagine how a nine dimension looks but I implemented it😅
 Exactly
 There it was four dimensions
 Sepal width and length
 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
 Made me laugh more
 You switch your dreams so quickly😂
 Because you wanted to do MBA, you said that you took management related elective
 Now you are telling you're mentally preparing yourself for MS in some computer domain
 Be focused!😂
 Good Kuch
 *luck
 By the way..
 I'm speaking with respect to *document need*
 🤘🏻
 Learn whatever is required nicely and do it. Give me credits as *source of encouragement*😬😅
 😋
 I'm going home that day
 And even if I was here, I would not have come
 I usually don't feel comfortable in treats and parties kinda gathering
 I have few constraints for how a party/treat must be
 Which I'm sure people don't appreciate that
 So I don't go
 Simple
 I'm an old school
 Great.. I really miss it. But yes, you go ahead and treat all you friends and have fun
 I'm kinda sleepy
 I'll take leave now
 Shub ratri
 Think about that project
 All the best
 Please resend your previous messages which are to be replied. 
 Exams are going on fine! How about you ?😅
 Enjoying holidays ??

 That interests me.
 Yup
 You said you have been working on it. What leads have you got till now ? 
 That would be cool
 In a well organized way.
 😎
 Already started

 It is nice😎 but irrelevant
 As always dumb choice of a dumbo😂
 Then do call me so
 But honestly I wanted to stop teasing you from new year🤗
 I'm happy about it and I'm looking forward to read that book as well.
 I felt it might have been over and over again that might have bored you or hurt you sometimes. Can't afford losing respect and concern.
 Are you sure ?
 I welcome this
 And your message in Facebook when I was off from whatsapp and fb made me feel so good. Felt like I'm in indeed important for you😉
 Are you angry with me? Did I do anything wrong ? 😂😂😂
 When do you think your actions might have hurt me ??
 Well, I try to stay focussed before exam in exam hall. Don't worry that!😬
 I wasn't hurt. I was angy😂
 That's my style
 😎
 Dumms I will text you after a while. Have some guests a home
 Have a nice time sis. Catch you soon 😘
 See you soon in college as well. I too missed your company
 They are in BVB college hubli
 You'll have to do it independently!
 Exclusively for SJCE. Work on back end as well so that most of it will be benefitted for SJCE students
 And hey what happened to that project which you started as final year project under Srinath sir I guess ??
 😅 cool
 May be your plan wasn't proper
 What you think ?
 Your project plan of final year to do now
 By the way, nice dp!
 Happens !!
 How big is the book
 Mysteries of invisible theifs
 ?
 Cool
 I shall read that in train on my way back to Mysore
 I'll continue it in Mysore
 But in vacation I learnt shell scripting
 Node js and angular js
 🙈
 Yes absolutely. When I die.
 😂
 Shall I share something honestly with you ??
 Only if you're willing to listen
 Because I don't listen to your feeds
 What am I going to say ?
 I keep myself busy just because I miss Adithi every moment. It has been eight months I have been sending her single sided messages even though I'm aware there won't be any response.
 I need an excuse to escape from my loss.
 Feels good though but I can't accept that fact dummu
 No no.. Don't blame yourself. Nothing of that sort.
 Be free while talking to me please
 Trying to.
 If I do that frequently then I'll grow weak or you too will be bored.
 Yeah..
 Nope. I felt lucky about having one sis ..
 I shall experience that feeling and try falling asleep with that happiness
 Did I send you close pics?
 <Media omitted>
 Here she goes!
 Babies are awesome
 Anyway good night dumms
 Catch you soon😘

 That doesn't look good on fair skin toned girls
 Hmm okay
 But dance with light steps.
 I shall teach you
 Thrice I have performed in my school as a lead dancer of my team.
 On hritik roshan songs
 So I'm pretty good at it.
 Even in IIT Ropar I danced on a punjabi song
 Good.

 Put your leg a habit to dance frequently

 Even then😅then😅 he must say
 I don't accept this excuse though😂😂
 And listen what some day I'll imitate your dance style!😂
 Get ready!
 I've practised a lot😂😂
 No no.. If that's the case then I won't😬
 Basically heavy weight leads to no movements 😂😂
 I was looking at your sis. She is flexible
 You aren't😂😂
 How's her school going ?
 Which standard ?
 Wow
 Nice nice!!
 Younger siblings are always smarter
 What video is that ??
 Downloading at speed of 512kbps
 😭
 I had watched this!
 It's quite fine
 While listening to songs do you focus on lyrics ?
 If yes then listen to Border movie title song
 It'll give you goosebumps
 Make your taste better
 And stop listening to that depressing song

 Abababa !! Vinalekaa chachchi poyaanu
 Good good😂

 You speak so much already. Scroll our chat and it might be 100 km😂😂
 My English isn't good as well
 How will I help you in that?
 👏🏻👏🏻
 I'll continue with movie now. After lunch I need to go clean my bike as well.
 Enjoy holidays
 Looks like a slap
 Chamaat

 I found a doppelganger of Amrutha akka
 <Media omitted>

 Good night

 Happy birthday
 Happy journey
 Good luck
 Etc
 I'll have dinner and I'll be back
 You carry on
 Which text are you referring for teaching English grammar ?
 Wren and Martin ?
 Oh!
 Might be good!
 Dinner aaytha ?
 Late ?
 Oh!
 Just remind me once
 It was my way of practice
 Still taking classes ??
 Nice nice!
 Exceptions in this are really important
 Note:
 *uncountable nouns have no plurals*
 None
 My teacher was God!
 He taught us very well
 He has crushed us like anything
 I really adore him for his hard work in teaching
 Which was 1000 times more than that of ours in learning
 His name was Dhruvraj V Kulkarni
 DVK ajja
 Nick name😂
 Figures of speech
 😇 one moment to thank him now.
 Whats DOM ?
 This makes it necessary to you to study HTML again!
 😂 That's why I suggest you to use proper spellings first. That will help you frame proper sentences. And it may improve your language as well
 Oh!! Start designing few web pages
 Have you done any ?
 What's the use ? 😂
 Hmm .. Show once you're done
 Why don't you design a web page to explain Digestive System of human body
 With text, images, float CSS , header and footer
 I think these tags are enough for that page
 For me less than 20 min
 For you may be 30 min
 Not more than that
 When you start is your call 😬
 Web designing is meditation😇
 Is there anything in life which you have taken seriously? 😂
 Or something which you'll take seriously😂
 Yaa busy girl
 😅
 12 hours of sleep and so many work
 Makes you fall short of time
 I understand😂
 Oh nice!👏🏻
 And now?
 When I feel guilty that I haven't worked enough for the day I don't sleep at all. O work that night instead!
 I have seen people who are more serious than me. I still need to improve a lot.
 Working hard for it though!🙃
 <Media omitted>
 He is from IIT Madras
 He got into Google as well
 The above will inspire you I guess
 Because you have a lot better condition than him
 There goes the spirit
 Okay then.. I'll go do some work now!

 Eager to see the size difference live😀😂
 😂

 Do those offices serve half day on Saturdays?
 Then I'll have to go on some week days
 ✌🏻
 Don't you ever talk to me.👺
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
 Never thought these angles in you.
 Never ever expected this thing.
 How can you even think me considering you as a sister would be a joke?
 You're suppose to justify every above thing
 You there ??
 See see !!
 You must be knowing that
 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
 Yup! My friend suggested this new app of faking WhatsApp texts😂
 I tried on you😂
 Will do a stronger one on Swati
 😎
 How?
 That's so sweet!😘
 But I'm unhappy that my prank wasn't much successful😂
 I'm proud about it
 😂😂
 I actually wanted to see you scold me😂
 I thought of telling you to talk about this in college tomorrow
 Again I thought what if you slap me in anger😂
 That's why I told you now
 😂😂😂
 That's not what you meant here
 😬
 But it was fun😂
 But don't worry.. it won't be repeated
 🙌🏻
 😂
 Okay ask
 They will shortlist you for interviewing if your profile matches their requirements
 Then they follow their procedures
 About LinkedIn internship?
 They will usually be in summer
 For two months
 Are you speaking about that MTV LinkedIn internship??
 If so then don't apply! It's waste
 Yeah yeah
 Go ahead and apply
 They will respond if they find your profile good
 Update your profile
 I saw it yesterday. It's empty. At least update our DBMS project
 And get more connections. Endorsement helps
 I have mentioned yours in my profile already
 https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B75QtpN110F_YUdhRU5maVdnMFk

 Illa

 College server is hopeless
 Can't help.

 😄
 Good! Keep it up👏🏻👏🏻
 Finish it by the end of this month. I'll conclude you were serious
 👍🏼
 8.96
 Thank you😎
 World is so weird.
 People update display pictures wearing a college bag.
 But don't come to college.
 😅
 I actually thought so looking at smiling face. Nobody wears a smile while coming to college😅
 Okay
 Actually guitar app works online
 😅
 As message was kinda important I replied
 My reply to this missed something. It was _sorry_
 I'll make sure it won't be repeated
 I understand
 I actually have no idea about who is with whom😂
 How do we do?
 Should I be laughing now ??
 Of course yes😂😂😂
 Learn it fully. It sounds interesting
 Also learn any short comings in it
 So that you can work on it
 Did you come to know the new rules in college??
 No parking near BB court. 
 Nobody allowed in the campus after 6:30 pm
 And parking in that parking lot to be done as per that security guards directions
 Vice principal has taken disciplinary action
 That's why the CCTV on the department as well
 *in
 Not might have.. it has indeed happened
 😂
 I have tutorials tomorrow
 I'll sleep now
 Good night!!
 I'll get back to you soon
 going for dinner now
 I know that you need publications and LOR's for GRE. It would be great if you concern someone who has good knowledge in that direction.
 Paper publication means you need to do research. Submit it to conference.
 About LOR for GRE ask someone who has done it
 Ask Manimala ma'am
 And Trisila ma'am.
 AMC will surely recommend
 Yup
 For your requirement of MS/MBA I don't know
 For my internships till date anyone was fine with whom I've worked
 👍🏼
 Algorithm to move out of depression
 😂
 😂
 Explore something that is unanswered
 Work on it
 It's research
 That's a technical article
 Not a research paper
 👍🏼
 Hi!
 
 Dummi listening to him so keen
 😂😂
 Wow😂
 I'm not finding any essence in him
 I don't know why though
 😬
 Chalo bye. I'll take leave now
 Haven't decided now if to go with that project
 Yup!
 But seriously you're stalking people at 12am ??
 No! Reading stuff on quora
 Okay
 As far as system software project is concerned, I'll either do it alone or as team of three as there are odd number of students in B2.
 That decision now depends on ma'am
 😅 Yeah.. I'm pretty sure she will permit one team of three guys rather than a team of two and me alone as the former will reduce their work too
 I'll not let that happen😂
 Anyway we all are in same batch
 Solution is very clear
 Me alone or me, Rahul and Saif as a team.
 So no entertainment for you.
 And probably this same team along with ayush may continue as final year project team
 Wherever I'm there that forms a good team indeed😬
 Project on sentiment analysis probably
 No algorithm can be trained with your data😂
 I will send you a pic. May be you'll find an answer
 <Media omitted>
 😂😂 Let's see
 For that you first need to change yourself
 A lot!
 I mean *a lot*
 Good good
 Did she ask any doubts?
 😅😂 What a shame
 😂
 Okay okay! You get angry very soon
 What exactly did you teach her?
 This sounds good.
 But make sure that you teach her everything in a right way
 Because
 *things you know can be forgotten but things you learn cannot be unlearned*
 👍🏼
 Good girl she is
 Learn something from her.
 Dummi
 Oh my God
 I have heard people seeing their childhood in their next generation's attitude but you're seeing it in your sis😂
 Nice nice
 Oh🤔
 It's fine. Why are you being annoyed?? My theories are bit out of the crowd.
 I think I should seriously control my conversation with you.
 I know
 This is for a different reason😅
 I have my reason😂
 This is called as digital dhamki
 😂
 As a part of this move. I'll block you right away
 😂
 Don't get me wrong. It's not just you. I'll not be receiving anyone's call when I am working
 This is not possible!😂
 I'm done with all my work for the day. I have few more posts to read on Quora. I'll read and sleep soon
 Happy Sankranti🎉🎊
 Good night!
